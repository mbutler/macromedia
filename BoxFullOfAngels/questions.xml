I notice that you avoid equating angels with media literally, in terms of the parallel of angels as messengers of the divine, if you will.
			
			<media>McLuhan> I want to say that electric media literally translated us into angels.  On the phone ‘we are there’ and ‘they are here’, and so with radio and TV.  Angelism and the occult alike are the by-products of electronics.
				 Benjamin> Though angels are the messengers of the divine, they are not the medium through which the divine talks.  A medium, if you will, allows the transmission and reception of a message, yes, let us ignore that quote catch phrase you just referred to and say that there is some message, some content.
				
				<content>McLuhan> When I say that we become angels, what I am wanting to say is that we become the content of media, we are disembodied, and thus angels.
				</content>
				
				<translator>McLuhan> I don’t think that angels as media and angels as translators are exclusive of each other.  All media are active metaphors in their power to translate experience into new forms.
					 Benjamin> I would say that the angel is more closely related to the translator.  The angel as messenger exists only so that he can give the divine’s message to man, which man would otherwise be unable to receive.  
				
				</translator>
				
				<metaphor>Benjamin> We can acknowledge that the divine is sublime, beyond our understanding.  The divine is present in everything, everywhere, and at all times.  The metaphor of angel as media then does not function because there is no need to conquer space or time.  
				</metaphor>
				
				<god>Benjamin> Angels are the messengers of God, they mediate communication between God and man.  They exist only for the duration of delivery, and in that sense, they do sound something like media.

			<judaism>Benjamin> Well, in Judaism we believe that Angels can cross the boundary between heaven and earth, which may lend credence to what you’re saying.  That does sound like space, I must admit.

			<condition>McLuhan> I’m saying that electric man tends toward the disembodied or discarnate condition of “angel”.

				<media>McLuhan> In other words, I am saying that, yes, you’re right, I’m not equating angels with media, but rather with the content of the media. (laughter).
				</media>
			</as>
			
			<medium>McLuhan> I am thinking that many of my critics would point to my so often misused catch phrase, “the medium is the message’ to say that if angels are the content, they must also be the medium, since the two are the same when the medium is the message.

			<information>McLuhan > Media is about the transmission of information.  I see information as inherently spiritual, in form at least.  Information is spirit in that it has no physical presence outside of the medium that contains it.  Information, as spiritual, is then connected to angels.
			</information>
			
			<space>McLuhan> I would still argue for space.  Not just because I am a Catholic, but because of the nature of divinity and more particularly, of the subject at hand.  Angels are spatial, not temporal.
			</space>
			
			<disembodied>McLuhan> Angels are disembodied, they inhabit the realm of the spirit.  This very definition presumes a spatial frame rather than a temporal one.  Angels are disembodied in space not time.

			<history>Benjamin> For The Angel, I take as my starting point the allegory of the Angel of History.  I’m concerned with the way that what we call progress, and now I am getting more concerned with these new forms of technology, this progress is about man’s need to conquer space.  In doing this, our relationship to time suffers.  As I said before, time is holy, it’s divine, and through time we connect to the messiah.
				<time>Benjamin> I do use angels allegorically in my early work, as I said before, and though I diverge from this in The Angel, there is, I still see history and time as central to any understanding of angels.

				<god>Benjamin> The Angel connects this together clearly.  We see that, on the one hand, angels, in their connection to God, as the translator of the divine, as holy they are connected to time.  This is of course all read through my own connection to Judaism.  Technology, media, computers, the cult of the electronic, all of this is a result of man’s desire to conquer space, which itself is connected, and I don’t mean to point fingers, all of this is connected to Catholicism.

	<utterance>Benjamin> In existing for only a moment, for the duration of communication between man and God, the angel comes to resemble the speech act.  Angels are an utterance of God, the language of God.  This is why I think of angels as translators, this connection they have to language.

	<marx>Benjamin> I’ve always found it funny that since my death, so many have fought over whether I am Marxist or Jewish.  As if these are not compatible.  It was an angel that helped Marx write his manifesto after all.  [laughter] Yes, only Germans understand this joke.
			<history>Benjamin> What is missing is the understanding that Marxism is entirely about history.  My concern with historical materialism can’t be understood without its connection to the divinity of time, and of course then history, that is at the center of Judaism.

	<derrida>Benjamin> That is why I appreciate Derrida, he understands the importance of a textual existence above and against the immaterial primacy of being.  Here text is about time.  Being, though it could easily be about time, is refigured to be set against the body, it is about space.

		<time>Benjamin> Judaism is a religion of time.  We celebrate the divinity of time over space.  The Sabbath is defined in time, whereas Catholicism especially is defined by the space of Mass.

	<messianic>
		<time>Benjamin> For The Angel, I take as my starting point the allegory of the Angel of History.  I’m concerned with the way that what we call progress, and now I am getting more concerned with these new forms of technology, this progress is about man’s need to conquer space.  In doing this, our relationship to time suffers.  As I said before, time is holy, it’s divine, and through time we connect to the messiah.

	<conquer>
		<space>Benjamin> The Angel connects this together clearly.  We see that, on the one hand, angels, in their connection to God, as the translator of the divine, as holy they are connected to time.  This is of course all read through my own connection to Judaism.  Technology, media, computers, the cult of the electronic, all of this is a result of man’s desire to conquer space, which itself is connected, and I don’t mean to point fingers, all of this is connected to Catholicism.
