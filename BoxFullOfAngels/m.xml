	<angel>
	When I used the terms “Angels” and also “discarnate man” I was referring to the tendency by which media turn us into angels.
			<media>
			I want to say that electric media literally translated us into angels.  On the phone ‘we are there’ and ‘they are here’, and so with radio and TV.  Angelism and the occult alike are the by-products of electronics.
				 
				<content>
				When I say that we become angels, what I am wanting to say is that we become the content of media, we are disembodied, and thus angels.
				</content>
				
				<translator>
				I don’t think that angels as media and angels as translators are exclusive of each other.  All media are active metaphors in their power to translate experience into new forms.

			</media>
			
			<condition>
			I’m saying that electric man tends toward the disembodied or discarnate condition of “angel”.
			</condition>
			
			<as>
				<media>
				In other words, I am saying that, yes, you’re right, I’m not equating angels with media, but rather with the content of the media. (laughter).
				</media>
			</as>
			
			<medium>
			I am thinking that many of my critics would point to my so often misused catch phrase, “the medium is the message’ to say that if angels are the content, they must also be the medium, since the two are the same when the medium is the message.
			</medium>

			</message>
			
			<information>
			Media is about the transmission of information.  I see information as inherently spiritual, in form at least.  Information is spirit in that it has no physical presence outside of the medium that contains it.  Information, as spiritual, is then connected to angels.
			</information>
			
			<space>
			I would still argue for space.  Not just because I am a Catholic, but because of the nature of divinity and more particularly, of the subject at hand.  Angels are spatial, not temporal.
			</space>
			
			<disembodied>
			Angels are disembodied, they inhabit the realm of the spirit.  This very definition presumes a spatial frame rather than a temporal one.  Angels are disembodied in space not time.

		<condition>
		I’m saying that electric man tends toward the disembodied or discarnate condition of “angel”.
		</condition>
		
		<space>
		If I am correct to say that electric man, mediated and plugged in man, tends toward the disembodied or discarnate condition of “angel,” then we are most certainly talking in terms of space not time.  To be disembodied or discarnate is to be afloat in space.

	<message>
	Oh most certainly, my point was not to say that there is no message, or that the content doesn’t count, but merely that it is less important than the medium through which it is being transmitted.

	<prophet>
	I have heard people refer to me as the prophet of postmodernism.  I’m not sure what that means for me now, in this state.  If a prophet is supposed to be the mouthpiece of God, then do they become Angels in the afterlife?

	<technology>
	The way technology seems to be moving, well, I’m talking about what I can see from up here, technology seems to push man in the direction of pure information.  This is why we call it the information age.  If that’s so, then information, and the media that contains it, translates man into spiritual forms, into angels.

	<memory>
	When I lost those five years of memory, that was hard.  I can see what you mean about the divinity of time.  Still, I am a Catholic, a Scholastic if you will, and in that I place my faith in senses.  Senses are about the physical world, about our interfacing with that world.  It is about space.
