	<angel>
	That is not how I use the figure of the angel in my early work, there it is more allegorical, but there is a similarity in the way I use it in The Angels.  I notice that you avoid equating angels with media literally, in terms of the parallel of angels as messengers of the divine, if you will.
		<prayer>
		The idea that angels bring the prayers of man before God is present in the Talmud.  Yet, we also see the rabbis taking care that we not mistake angels as messengers and angels as message, or perhaps more appropriately, as receiver. I wonder how this fits with the notion of the medium as the message?

		<hebrew>
		The reason the Talmud tells us that prayers must be said in Hebrew is that, unlike God, angels only speak one language.  If angels are to be the translators of God to man, then how can angels speak only Hebrew?

			<media>
			Though angels are the messengers of the divine, they are not the medium through which the divine talks.  A medium, if you will, allows the transmission and reception of a message, yes, let us ignore that quote catch phrase you just referred to and say that there is some message, some content.
			<message>
			If angels are media, are they then the message? In Judaism, there is a widely established doctrine that the Law on Sinai was communicated to Moses through angels. So do angels, as media and thus message, become the Law?  I may have to reject this idea of medium as message, or perhaps just insist that angels are translators rather than media.

				<translator>
				I would say that the angel is more closely related to the translator.  The angel as messenger exists only so that he can give the divine’s message to man, which man would otherwise be unable to receive.  
				</translator>
				
				<metaphor>
				We can acknowledge that the divine is sublime, beyond our understanding.  The divine is present in everything, everywhere, and at all times.  The metaphor of angel as media then does not function because there is no need to conquer space or time.  
				</metaphor>
				
				<god>Angels are the messengers of God, they mediate communication between God and man.  They exist only for the duration of delivery, and in that sense, they do sound something like media.

			<translate>
					<divine>The angel’s job is to translate the wishes of the divine, something otherwise completely beyond our understanding, into something that we humans can comprehend.

			<judaism>Well, in Judaism we believe that Angels can cross the boundary between heaven and earth, which may lend credence to what you’re saying.  That does sound like space, I must admit.

			<history>
			For The Angel, I take as my starting point the allegory of the Angel of History.  I’m concerned with the way that what we call progress, and now I am getting more concerned with these new forms of technology, this progress is about man’s need to conquer space.  In doing this, our relationship to time suffers.  As I said before, time is holy, it’s divine, and through time we connect to the messiah.
				<time>
				I do use angels allegorically in my early work, as I said before, and though I diverge from this in The Angel, there is, I still see history and time as central to any understanding of angels.

		There is a stagnation that hangs over spatial society.  It’s as if all people are stuck within a collective dream, a kind of fogginess brought about by the commodity oriented culture of spatial society.

	As Marx said, and I’m paraphrasing, the reformation of consciousness lies solely in our waking the world from the dream it is having about itself.

	Can it be that waking is the synthesis of dream consciousness as thesis and awakened consciousness as antithesis? Then the moment of waking would be identical with the moments of recognition when things put on their true-surrealistic-face.

		To wake from out collective dream, which is to of course to break from the commodity oriented culture of spatial society, requires time.  Time, a particular dialectic moment in time, can overcome the dream imposed on us by space, by spatial society.
